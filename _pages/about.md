I’m <span style="font-weight: bold;">Aakash</span>, a Master’s candidate in Computer Science with a specialization in Artificial Intelligence at [RPTU-Kaiserslautern](https://rptu.de/). Within the Computer Science department, I am part of the [Robotics Research Lab](https://rrlab.cs.rptu.de/), where I am advised by Jakub Pawlak and Prof. Karsten Berns. I also did a stint at [DFKI](https://www.dfki.de/web), the German Research Center for Artificial Intelligence, as a AI Research Assistant in the Augmented Vision Group, where I contributed to the development of Digital [Twin4Trucks](https://www.dfki.de/web/news/foerderprojekt-twin4trucks-startet).

My research interests lie broadly in Artificial Intelligence, with a particular focus on autonomous driving. My overarching research question investigates how Large Language Models (LLMs) can enhance the decision-making and reasoning capabilities of autonomous driving systems, improving safety and adaptability. I explore these challenges as part of my master’s thesis, with a specific emphasis on off-road scenarios.
